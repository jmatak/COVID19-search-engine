However, the growth rate of COVID19 in the US has been rapid, increasing from 69 cases on 2/29/20 to 4661 confirmed cases just 17 days later. 2 Due to the current state of COVID19 testing, US statistics on confirmed COVID19 cases may not be the most reliable, either. Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

Cigarette smoking decreases lung function, and evidently poses a general risk factor for severe respiratory infections, thus there is an apparent association between cigarette smoking and COVID-19 severity. The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more severe in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further investigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of second-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according to published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be well assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function as early as 1 month. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as part of public health measures to limit the global impact of COVID-19.</td>\n",

However, there are limitations that cannot be addressed with currently available evidence and data. Confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, should be considered in examining if access of Chinese smokers with COVID-19 to hospital care may be different as compared to the non-smoking population. While the pooled prevalence of smoking was not adjusted for gender, gender distribution of the patients included in the studies was similar to population estimates (51.1% males). [27] At this time, it is impossible to perform a multivariate analysis or examine the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization according to the smoking status in a population-representative sample. The consistency and accuracy of the recorded smoking status are also unknown. Considering the emergency of the epidemic, it is possible that the smoking status of patients was not accurately recorded or some patients were unable to report their smoking status. It is also possible that some patients may have been in critical condition at the time they were hospitalized, which would compromise their communication capacity and their ability to report their smoking status. One study reported that the group of never smokers included patients with unknown smoking status, but the authors did not report the number of patients with unknown smoking status. [14] One study mentioned that “few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years”, but it was unclear if only patients with 30 pack years or more were presented in the study table [19]. At the same time, two studies may have included former smokers into the groups referred to as “smoking” or “smoking history” [23, 25]. In any case, the large difference between smoking prevalence among patients and population smoking prevalence is difficult to be fully explained by missing data on the smoking status. The smoking status was not objectively assessed, but this is common and expected practice in case series of hospitalized patients. Another possibility is that some patients may have quit smoking shortly after disease initiation and before admission to hospital; these patients would be registered as former smokers. However, the secondary analysis, which classified former smokers as current smokers, also found a low pooled smoking prevalence. While only 3 out of the 13 studies reported former smoking and 2 studies reported smoking without clarifying if they were current or former smokers, a study by Lui et al. found that only 8.4% of males and 0.8% of females in China were former smokers [28]. Consider the low prevalence of former smoking in the Chinese population, it is possible that none of the patients were former smokers in some of the studies. Another limitation is that differences in population smoking prevalence may exist between age groups, considering that age is a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization would be more likely for older people. A study by Liu et al. reported that the highest smoking prevalence in China was observed in males aged 40–59 years [28]. The median age in all the studies analyzed herein was < 59 years. Additionally, high smoking prevalence was observed among older Chinese males by Liu et al. Specifically, the prevalence of current smoking in males was: 46.5% in 18–29 years, 57.6% in 30–39 years, 60.3% in 40–49 years, 59.5% in 50–59 years, 52.2% in 60–69 years and 41.5% in 70+ years. In females, the highest smoking rates were observed in those aged 50 years or higher (4.7–8.7%) compared to younger age groups (1.7–2.6%) [28]. Moreover, the 2018 GATS reported that prevalence of current smoking was 57.7% and 2.7% in males and females, respectively, in age groups 45–64 years, and 44% and 4.1%, respectively, in age group ≥ 65 years [12]. Thus, it is unlikely that age was a factor that substantially affected the present analysis. In any case, the calculated pooled prevalence of current smoking was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence in China. Such a difference could only be explained by massive under-reporting of current smoking.</td>\n",

The risks associated with smoking have been disputed, with increased risks initially reported, but some more recent reports finding that smokers are under-represented in those with more severe disease, and a potential protective mechanism for nicotine has been suggested 9,49 : smoking prevalence was lower than expected among hospitalised patients in China, 10 France 11 and the USA. 50 Even if smoking does have a small protective effects against COVID-19, this would still be massively outweighed by the well-established adverse health effects of smoking.</td>\n",

A total of 5960 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from China were presented in all studies. The majority (55.1%) were males. The mean or median age ranged from 38 to 68 years, with some studies presenting mean age in different subgroups. One study presented patients divided into two subgroups according to age (< 60 years and ≥ 60 years) [16] while another one reported cases according to the presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. [17] In both studies, the 2 subgroups were combined and treated as one sample. Two studies reported the smoking status as \"history of smoking\" or \"smoking\". [23, 25] Although it was unclear if this included both current and former smokers, we analyzed the data assuming they were all current smokers. In most studies, former smokers were not reported ( Table 1) . The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4 to 12.6%. The random effects pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.5% (95% CI 4.9-8.2%). Findings from the random-effects meta-analysis are presented in Fig. 1 . The observed outcome is the estimated prevalence of current smoking among those who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The forest plot depicts the fractional prevalence of smokers in each study. The size of the dark squares is proportional to the weight each study has in determining the combined effect size estimate. The combined effect estimate is depicted via the dark diamond (RE Model), with the 95% confidence interval corresponding to the width of the diamond. The meta-analysis also indicated statistically significant heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001).</td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

To halt a pandemic, a suitable quarantine period should be set by investigating incubation periods. Thus, understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to design public health efforts. In this cohort, the full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. Both male and female adults had their median incubation periods of 7-day, which is 1.8-day longer than those in other reports 3,4 (see discussion). However, a similar result was released in the recent news from the Chinese Medical Association that the median incubation periods were 5-7 days 5 . The median incubation period (9-day) of children were significantly longer than those of adults (t-test P = 0.02). For adults, the incubation periods for the majority (66.5%) of the cases were 1-9 days: most of them (57.6% and 52.0% for males and females, respectively) had 1-5 days incubation.</td>\n",

Due to the 14-day incubation period of the virus, 6 coupled with the current resource limitations in the US, COVID19 infections will not be detected until symptoms become evident. To estimate the asymptomatic infected population, we looked at publicly available data with at least 15 days of significant increase in confirmed COVID19 case numbers and back-calculated the population count that would have likely been in the pre-symptomatic incubation phase on previous dates. This means that, for any time t, the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals can be estimated using the sum of new infections that were confirmed on t + 1 to t + 14 as follows:</td>\n",

The incubation period is the time from infection to the onset of the disease. It provides the foundation for epidemiological prevention, clinical actions, and drug discovery. Different viruses have different incubation periods that determine their different dynamics epidemiologically. The incubation period of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the incubation period for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [5] [6] . However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period of COVID-19, although WHO estimates it is between 2 to 14 days after exposure [8] .

The main difficulty is in that it is difficult to determine the infected time. Based on patients' information, some works have reported the incubation period of COVID-19. For example, Yang et al. [4] reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4.75 days; the interquartile range is 3.0 − 7.2 days. Hereinafter, we try to estimate the incubation period of patients in Henan. The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed). To facilitate us to estimate the incubation period, we define estimated incubation period as the period from the date of exposure to the date of appearing clinical symptoms or making a definite diagnosis. Apparently, such definition overestimates the actual incubation period. For example, the information from a patient .

In this concise review we queried on the effects of corticosteroids in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2. We performed a literature search on PubMed, regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2, as well as their impact on glycemia in pregnant women with or without diabetes. Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviridae may have effects on glycemia. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised while using corticosteroids in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring preterm delivery </td>\n",

Anti-viral therapy for COVID-19, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, should be determined by weighing the risks and benefits. Treatment can be initiated when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Even after the viral infection is controlled, the intrauterine development of the fetus should be closely monitored since the early gestation data is lacking, and placental inflammation may persist for a prolonged time. Pregnant women with COVID-19 should be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period since they had anti-viral drug therapy and radiation exposure from CT examinations.</td>\n",

Although current clinical studies exclude pregnant women, Remdesivir may be administered in critically-ill pregnant patients (NCT0428070500) (77) . To date, no information is available concerning the effects of Remdesivir in pregnancy. Due to the increased release of cytokines and subsequent inflammatory damage during COVID-19, Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the receptor IL-6, has been used in China, with at least one clinical trial that is ongoing (NCT04310228) (78, 79) . A major concern for pregnant patients is that IgG isotype antibodies cross the placenta at an increasing rate in accordance with gestational age (79) . However, the effect of each medication on fetal development is unknown. Furthermore, in the rheumatology literature it is recommended that Tocilizumab be avoided during pregnancy given the lack of data on adverse fetal effects (80) . Other anti-viral medications which have been utilized that have clear evidence of teratogenicity, either in humans or animal models, include Favipiravir and Ribavirin (68, 81, 82) . Notably, the aforementioned medications are experimental, thus it is imperative to have a risk-benefit discussion with patients given the medication side-effect profiles, potential effects in pregnancy, and unknown benefits. Until randomized trials with adequate controls are completed, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions concerning the efficacy of any of these treatments (71) .</td>\n",

More evidence is needed to develop effective preventive and clinical strategies.

Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

Objective: To summarize current understanding of the effects of novel and prior coronaviruses on human reproduction, specifically male and female gametes, and in pregnancy. Design: Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6, 2020. Methods: Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results: Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropindependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection may adversely affect some pregnant women and their offspring. Additional studies are needed to assess effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male and female fertility. </td>\n",

       ". There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8]. There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7]. In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8]. Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses’ infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.</td>\n",

However, the growth rate of COVID19 in the US has been rapid, increasing from 69 cases on 2/29/20 to 4661 confirmed cases just 17 days later. 2 Due to the current state of COVID19 testing, US statistics on confirmed COVID19 cases may not be the most reliable, either. Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

However, the growth rate of COVID19 in the US has been rapid, increasing from 69 cases on 2/29/20 to 4661 confirmed cases just 17 days later. 2 Due to the current state of COVID19 testing, US statistics on confirmed COVID19 cases may not be the most reliable, either. Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

[1, 2] . Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, were highlighted as risk factors for fatality. With a limited sample sized study Guo et al. demonstrated effects of comorbid conditions on cardiac outcomes. Their results could be biased by certain confounders. Cardiotoxicity might also be associated with drugs used in treatment of comorbidities rather than the comorbidity itself. In order to overcome confounders, multivariate analysis is needed which also include comedications along with comorbidities. COVID-19 has high fatality among elderly (>60 years). Excess fatality might also be associated with polypharmacy -commonly seen in elderly-and drug related problems besides comorbidities and the disease itself [3] . hydroxychloroquine related QT-prolongation may also manifest even after hospitaldischarge. We suggest follow-up ECG evaluations for people who receive hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Telemedicine fueled with ECG monitoring could be implemented for follow-ups.</td>\n",

Interestingly, almost all children are either asymptomatic or present with very minor symptoms, while elderly and those with underlying conditions experience very severe life-threatening symptoms. This disparity was also observed with SARS-CoV-1, a closely related virus which failed to kill any children under the age of 12, despite being much more lethal than SARS-CoV-2 in adults 6 .

While we are not certain about a potential summer effect, particularly on virus survivability, we have found it to be a useful context to demonstrate the sensitivity of outbreak dynamics to the transmission rate β. In Figure 9 , we plotted the total infected and the hospitalizations under four different scenarios with respect to the summer effect. The plot shows the tradeoff between an early summer effect versus a later but more significant summer effect. The figure also demonstrates the impact of a 25% to 50% reduction in the transmission rate as well as the impact of the timing of the summer effect in flattening the curve further.</td>\n",

Specifically, the relationship was approximately linear in the range of b3°C and became flat above 3°C, indicating that the single threshold of the temperature effect on COVID-19 was 3°C. Based on results from GAMs, a piecewise linear regression was adapted with a threshold at a 3°C to quantify the effect of temperature above and below the threshold. As showed in Table 3 , each 1°C rise in mean temperature (lag0-7) led to a 3.432% (95% CI: 2.277-4.586) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases when mean temperature was below 3°C. This positive effect is largest at lag0-21 (percentage change = 6.953%, 95% CI: 4.681-9.225). When mean temperature was above 3°C, the negative effect of temperature was not statistically significant.</td>\n",

Several recent reports have also linked higher temperature to decreased virus spread, while others have found no significant effects. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Here, we demonstrate an independent effect of temperature that results in reduced COVID-19 cases, but not mortality, across U.S. counties. If warmer temperatures do, in fact, play a role in mitigating disease spread, it is reasonable to expect a potential seasonal trend in global cases and mortality. As temperatures begin to warm in the Northern hemisphere during the summer months, we may begin to see a decrease in disease burden; however, we should prepare to see a resurgence in COVID-19 incidence when temperatures again decrease in the fall and winter months, as has been exhibited in previous pandemics like the Spanish flu. 46 Likewise, countries in the Southern hemisphere should be prepared to experience seasonal trends in the opposite direction.</td>\n",

While we are not certain about a potential summer effect, particularly on virus survivability, we have found it to be a useful context to demonstrate the sensitivity of outbreak dynamics to the transmission rate β. In Figure 9 , we plotted the total infected and the hospitalizations under four different scenarios with respect to the summer effect. The plot shows the tradeoff between an early summer effect versus a later but more significant summer effect. The figure also demonstrates the impact of a 25% to 50% reduction in the transmission rate as well as the impact of the timing of the summer effect in flattening the curve further.</td>\n",

Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.</td>\n",

Design: With a priori information obtained from the daily number of deaths due to CODIV-19 in China and data from the Peruvian authorities, we constructed a predictive Bayesian non-linear model for the number of deaths in Peru. Exposure: COVID-19. Outcome: Number of deaths. Results: Assuming an intervention level similar to the one implemented in China, the total number of deaths in Peru is expected to be 612 (95%CI: 604.3 -833.7) persons. Sixty four days after the first reported death, the 99% of expected deaths will be observed. The inflexion point in the number of deaths is estimated to be around day 26 (95%CI: 25.1 -26.8) after the first reported death. Conclusion: These estimates can help authorities to monitor the epidemic and implement strategies in order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. </td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID19 transmission. Modelbased predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID19.</td>\n",

COVID-19 can also spread through other means. In Section IV-C, we discussed using beacons to deal with spread over longer distance in closed space, such as some form of airborne transmissions in restaurants or conference halls. The tracing for those situations works similarly as that for close-distance human contacts, except that the number of individuals that need to be screened is likely much larger. There are also transmissions through shared surfaces, such as shared coffee tables or elevator buttons. The beacon approach can also be useful for some of those situations to pinpoint the locations of transmissions. There will be situations where none of the device-based approaches can catch the origin of infection. In our framework, we could view each of such occasions as the start of a cluster. The first patient of the cluster will later be identified through tracing after transmissions through person-to-person contact begin. In the end, it is still the person-to-person direct transmissions that are of the primary concern, because both sides of each transmission are mobile. Furthermore, if transmissions of this type can be dealt with effectively, fewer people will be infected and less of the shared environment will be contaminated.</td>\n",

Although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of COVID-19 have not been precisely elucidated, they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission, because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics. 23 The measures implemented in Hong Kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland China, and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide. If these measures and population responses can be sustained, avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of COVID-19.</td>\n",

However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002-03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals.</td>\n",

Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. 1 Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact.</td>\n",

Some countries such as Singapore have demonstrated the feasibility of contact tracing when sufficient testing capacities are available to quarantine exposed individuals and contain disease spread (Anderson et al., 2020) . In nations where contact tracing is not feasible, \"social distancing\" policies have been implemented by a subset of governments. These policies include closure of nonessential workplaces and schools, as well as policies on physical spacing when in public aimed at preventing viral transmission to reduce the number of new COVID19 cases.</td>\n",

The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 [7] . Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13] , which is slightly higher than that of SARS.</td>\n",

The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 [7] . Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13] , which is slightly higher than that of SARS.</td>\n",

Here, the R0 is the basic reproduction number of COVID-19. The k measures the likelihood of occurrence of super-spreading events (or other factors) which could vary the growth rate. If k is smaller than 1, these data indicate occurrence of super-spreading events (larger proportion of 'super-spreaders' or 'dead-ends' in infected individuals) or some other factors which could vary the growth rate; otherwise if k is larger than 1, these data do not indicate occurrence of super-spreading events [4] .</td>\n",

We evaluated the impact of small-area lockdowns in Chile, aimed to reduce viral transmission while minimizing the population disrupted. The effectiveness of this intervention on the outbreak control is unknown. A natural experiment assessing the impact of small-area lockdowns between February 15th and April 25th, 2020. We used mobility data and official governmental reports to compare regions with smallarea lockdowns versus regions without. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the effective reproductive number (Re) of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were changes in mobility indicators. We used quasi-experimental methods for the analysis and examined the impact of other concurrent public health interventions to disentangle their effects. Small-area lockdown produced a sizable reduction in human mobility, equivalent to an 11.4% reduction (95%CI -14.4% to -8.38%) in public transport and similar effects in other mobility indicators. Ten days after implementation, the small-area lockdown produced a reduction of the effective reproductive number (Re) of 0.86 (95%CI -1.70 to -0.02). School and university closures, implemented earlier, led to a 40% reduction in urban mobility. Closure of educational institutions resulted in an even greater Re reduction compared with small-area lockdowns. Small-area lockdowns produced a reduction in mobility and viral transmission, but the effects were smaller than the early closures of schools and universities. Small-area lockdowns may have a relevant supporting role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and could be useful for countries considering scaling-down stricter social distancing interventions. </td>\n",

Clinical manifestations of the disease resemble those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The mortality rate is lower than in SARS (Zhou, Yu et al. 2020 ) but the incidence rate is significantly higher. The current COVID-19 epidemic differs in several aspects from the previous one caused by SARS, which was finally extinguished (Cossarizza, De Biasi et al. 2020 , Kucharski, Russell et al. 2020 , Kuniya 2020 , Leung 2020 , Mizumoto, Kagaya et al. 2020 , Parodi and Liu 2020 . First, COVID-19 has a higher basic reproductive number, R 0 , than SARS. Second, in contrast to SARS, causative pathogen transmission in COVID-19 starts before the end of the incubation stage of the disease. Third, unlike SARS, many (and possibly most) cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but they are accompanied by a spread of causative pathogen. These features of COVID-19 lower the optimism for the prospect that the current epidemic will be successfully controlled.</td>\n",
