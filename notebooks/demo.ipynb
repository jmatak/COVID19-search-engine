Apart from the numerous chemicals, surgical smoke had been shown to harbour intact bacterial and virus particles especially COVID-19 in the current time. Objective: To identify the inhalational, infectious, chemical, and mutagenic risks of surgical smoke and suggest evidence-based hazard reduction strategies. Also to cogitate on the very high risk of viral spread spread by the use of surgical diathermy in COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed using the keywords surgical smoke, diathermy, electrocautery, surgical smoke hazards, smoke evacuator, and guidelines for surgical smoke safety was performed. The review included evidences from 50 articles from the dermatology, surgery, infectious disease, obstetrics, and cancer biology literature. There are risks associated with surgical smoke. Although some surgeons were aware, majority were not keen in the hazard reduction strategies. Many chemical and biological particles have been found in surgical smoke. It is highly recommended to follow the standardised guidelines for surgical smoke safety.

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others. 3 By contrast, for COVID19, the serial interval is estimated at 4·4-7·5 days, which is more similar to SARS. 4 First among the important unknowns about COVID19 is the case fatality rate (CFR), which requires information on the denominator that defines the number infected. We are unaware of any completed largescale serology surveys to detect specific antibodies to COVID19. Best estimates suggest a CFR for COVID19 of about 0·3-1%, 4 which is higher than the order of 0·1% CFR for a moderate influenza A season. 5 The second unknown is the whether infectiousness starts before onset of symptoms. The incubation period for COVID19 is about 5-6 days. 4, 6 Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infec tiousness (appendix 1). For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1-2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness. 7 There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period, 8 pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1-2 days before onset of symptoms. If these patterns are verified by more extensive clinical virological studies, COVID19 would be expected to be more like influenza A than SARS. For SARS, peak infectiousness took place many days after first symptoms, hence the success of quarantine of patients with SARS soon after symptoms started 7 and the lack of success for this measure for influenza A and possibly for COVID19.</td>\n",

However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

Lacking medical prophylactic measures to combat disease spread, many nations have adopted social distancing policies in order to mitigate transmission of CoV-2. While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the realworld efficacy of these approaches. Here, we quantify the spread rate of COVID19 before and after national social distancing measures were implemented in 26 nations and compare this to the changes in COVID19 spread rate over equivalent time periods in 27 nations that did not enact social distancing policies. We find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate. Using mixed linear regression models we estimate that social distancing policies reduced the spread of COVID19 by 66%. These data suggest that social distancing policies may be a powerful tool to prevent spread of COVID19 in real-world scenarios. </td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

More evidence is needed to develop effective preventive and clinical strategies.

Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 [7] . Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13] , which is slightly higher than that of SARS.</td>\n",

However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intu bation, admission to the intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. 9, 11 However, pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution, the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. 13, 14 Nonetheless, because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period, more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. As discussed in the study, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population, especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. Therefore, pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations, as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS, the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8, 2020, 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling, screening, and followups for pregnant women, reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing, and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed, to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

More evidence is needed to develop effective preventive and clinical strategies. The latest research by Huijun Chen and colleagues 5 reported in The Lancet provides some insight into the clinical characteristics, pregnancy outcomes, and vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection in pregnant women. Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

The rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. Lai et al.3 found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. However, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients. Clinical workers should pay attention to the risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death, identify critical patients early, allocate medical resources rationally and timely adjust the treatment plan to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death. In this article, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with critical/mortal illness and non-critical illness in 13 literatures with 3027 patients, to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 patients to develop critical disease or death, in order to effectively predict the progression of the disease, make early treatment response and allocate medical resources in a better way.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",
