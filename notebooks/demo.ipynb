For example, in meta-analyses, social isolation and loneliness were associated with a 50% increased risk of developing dementia, 2 an approximately 30% increased risk of incident coronary artery disease or stroke, 3 and a 26% increased risk of all-cause mortality. 4 Of special concern to the geriatric psychiatry community are the mental health implications for older adults. These markers of social disconnection increase the likelihood of developing or worsening late life depression and anxiety and, reciprocally, these psychiatric conditions also predispose to social disconnection. 5, 6 Though late adulthood is often a period of socialemotional well-being, it also poses an increasing risk of loneliness in the setting of age-related factors such as the loss of close relationships and the contraction of social networks, sensory impairments (especially hearing loss), chronic health conditions, mobility limitations, and other physical and cognitive declines. A nationally representative German study of over 16,000 adolescents and adults found the lowest prevalence of loneliness among individuals in the sixth to seventh decades of life, yet striking elevations in loneliness among those in the eighth decade and beyond. 7 For these reasons, effective interventions for social disconnection, especially loneliness, are much needed for older people.</td>\n",

A rapid counterscreen for irreversible inhibition is to incubate the target protein and the hit at 5× their apparent IC 50 and then dilute them 10fold (other IC 50 ratios may of course be chosen). If inhibition is rapidly reversible, the inhibition on dilution should drop to about 33% of full inhibition at this ratio. If dilution changes the inhibition little, it supports covalent activity. Legitimate, slow off-rate inhibition is another alternative, but such molecules are rare among initial screening hits. This experiment will only work for soluble proteins, but related experiments to measure off-rate may be adapted for membrane proteins.</td>\n",

Here we report the results for a city (Shenzhen-a major city with more than 12 million inhabitants in Guangdong province) and two provinces (Hunan and Shandong) for which we have validated our individual records against the full official line lists (appendix pp [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Results for the other six locations are included in the appendix (p 24). Although these locations were among those that reported the largest number of COVID-19 cases as of Feb 17, 2020, 3 they showed highly different transmission patterns. Specifically, in Shenzhen, we estimated that the mean R t was above the epidemic threshold for about 1 week (approximately from Jan 18 to Jan 23), with a maximum value of 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) on Jan 22, and the outbreak was mostly sustained by cases with travel history to or from Wuhan or Hubei (figure 3). In Hunan province, we estimated the mean R t to be above the epidemic threshold for about 2 weeks from Jan 13 to Jan 28, with a peak value of 1·34 on Jan 20 (1·06-1·68; If no information about the travel history of a patient was reported in the individual records, we assumed that the patient acquired the infection locally. This graph refers to 5683 cases with available symptom onset date (out of 8579 individual cases available in our individual records). The decline in the number of cases in the last few days of February is in part due to the delay between the date of reporting of cases and the date of symptom onset. The first period ran from Dec 24 to Jan 27. Dec 24 is the earliest symptom onset date of the cases reported outside Hubei. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.

Overall recommendations to avoid travel to China have been issued (eg, by the Ministry of Health of Nigeria). Communication campaigns have been intensified after the publication of WHO guidelines encouraging the provision of information to health professionals and the general public, often with 24 h dedicated hotlines, as in the case of Senegal. 3 Some countries remain ill-equipped. Some are without the diagnostic capacity for rapid testing for the virus; thus, if cases are imported, tests will need to be done abroad, which might critically increase the delay from identification of suspected cases to their confirmation and isolation, affecting possible disease transmission. WHO is currently supporting countries to improve their diagnostic capacity. In the African region, this capacity has now expanded from just two referral laboratories 4 to a larger set of countries, and is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks. 25 The capacity of these laboratories is still limited by the shortage of personnel trained to run the tests, and inadequate stock of materials needed to do these tests. It is essential to train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly, and preserve strict infection control measures.</td>\n",

In parallel, there has been a worldwide cooperative effort to develop a vaccine [22] and to develop numerous serological tests for the presence of antibodies [23] . If immunity is strongly implied by the outcomes of these latter tests, then individuals could be allowed to get back to work, particularly in healthcare and other key areas [2, 3] . The WHO, however, has warned that the very premise of COVID-19 immunity is itself uncertain: 'With regards to recovery and then reinfection ... we do not have the answers to that. That is an unknown' [24] . Some immunologists have indeed argued that COVID-19 immunity could be very weak, because 'reinfection is an issue with the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause about 10% to 30% of common colds' [25] . Others in that same discussion argue that immunity could be valid for 'a year or two', a view shared by Male, who with Golding and Bootman has written a clear exposition on the life-cycle of infection, antibody detection, and likely immunity to COVID-19 [26] . A related challenge is the quality of the testing: test sensitivity (% positive detection for the right antibodies, so high sensitivity means few false positives) and specificity (% negatives correctly detected, so high specificity means few false negatives) are undergoing great scrutiny even as we write this [27] , and are naturally a matter of concern, because they must be sufficiently high to make the approach worthwhile. In the meantime, our research aims to find an approach to achieve highly robust certification, so that it is ready to deploy as-and-when the ongoing biological research satisfies the necessary quality criteria.</td>\n",

A total of 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were referred to a designated hospital (the Jin Yin-tan Hospital). Of the 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed by next-generation sequencing or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Twenty-seven (66%, 27/41) patients had history of Huanan Seafood Market exposure.1 However, there is a caveat that the first case on December 1 did not show history of Huanan Seafood Market exposure and the subsequent cases started on December 10, nine days later. In the following days, a burst of cases was spreading from Wuhan to the whole Hubei province. Subsequently, many cities and provinces were attacked by this virus. One of the reasons may be due to the heavy transportation load during the Chinese Lunar New Year (on January 25) period. The first exported case was into Thailand on January 13, 2020. However, the disease spread rapidly and globally. Not only familial clusters but also outbreaks in ocean liners were reported. As of February 6, 2020, a total of 28,276 confirmed cases with 565 deaths globally were documented by WHO, involving at least 25 countries.3 The WHO issued an public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) alarm on January 30, 2020. Many stringent quarantine procedures and fever surveillance were underway. The initial mortality rates for patients in the hospital were estimated to be 11%–15%,1,15 but more recent data were 2%–3%. It is very likely that person-to-person transmissions occur via droplets and contact. Nosocomial infections in the healthcare facilities did happen and stress the importance of good infection control.</td>\n",

Blood glucose should be controlled for all patients during hospitalization to monitor the progress of illness and avoid aggravation. For critical cases, early identification and timely reduction adverse drug reaction (for instance, glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia) could prevent worse symptoms. During the 4-week follow-up period after discharge, blood glucose homeostasis should be maintained continuously and patients need to avoid infectious diseases due to a lower immune response. Long-term follow-up is still essential for diabetic patients to reduce diabetes-related complications and mortality. With the aim of preventing person-to-person transmission, a variety of online services of glucose management have been implemented widely for diabetic patients and general population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The popularization of Internet and smartphones, as well as emerging fifth generation networks, have ensured endocrinologists to provide remote medical consultation for the patients who are not advised to go to the hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, free educational videos and e-books on diabetes self-management and COVID-19 prevention have been provided for the public via WeChat mobile app. To date, these online services and resources have played remarkable roles in the nationwide COVID-19 control in China.</td>\n",

CBT should preferably be delivered online or via telephone to avoid the spread of infection. As online CBT does not require the presence of mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists), this will be helpful to the general public in China as there is a shortage of psychologists. Based on our findings, cognitive therapy can provide information or evidence to enhance confidence in the doctor's ability to diagnose COVID-19. Cognitive therapy can challenge cognitive bias when recipients overestimate the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. As the majority of the general population in this study was homebound for 20-24 h per day during the epidemic, behavior therapy could focus on relaxation exercises to counteract anxiety and activity scheduling (e.g., home-based exercise and entertainment) to counteract depression in the home environment. Self-administered acupressure and emotional freedom techniques derived from key principles within traditional Chinese medicine are potential interventions which may benefit the mental health of general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Further research Is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions.</td>\n",

There is a growing medication shortage across North America, including asthma medications such as albuterol. (39) In many cases, such as with albuterol, these medications increasingly are being used in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to help with respiratory issues. To help combat the shortage of albuterol specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic albuterol inhaler on April 8,2020. (44) If faced with albuterol shortage, other available options include substituting other short acting beta-agonists, using an expired albuterol inhaler, and ensuring good asthma control which reduces the need for reliever medications in general. (9, 39) Many of the substitute short acting beta-agonists are dry powder inhalers (diskus or turbuhaler) and as such children often need to be at least 6 years of age to produce enough inspiratory force to use these devices properly. (9, 45) For adolescents 12 years and older, another option is ICS-formoterol for both maintenance and relief therapy as supported by the Global Initiative for Asthma 2019 update. (46, 47) Nebulized albuterol should only be considered as a last resort, and proper infection prevention protocols need to be followed. (8, 9, 31) If no other medications are available, epinephrine inhalers might be considered as well, if used prudently. Medication withdrawal as part of research protocols also should be deferred to a later time.</td>\n",

Inter-chain proline-proline distance measurement shows that the corresponding RBD-NTD domains are far away in the case of SARS-CoV S (Fig. 4B ) and further away in the case of MERS-CoVS (Fig. 4C ). This measurement involves their respective Cryo-EM structures. Despite the relatively high degree of sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and the SARS-CoV S and also with the spike protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, a single histidine residue at the relevant RBD-NTD domain interface is found unique in the vase of SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. S5 ) (29) . The imidazole ring of histidine is pointing towards the hydrophobic assembly of aforesaid proline-tyrosine in the juxtaposition of the RBD-S1 hinge region. Such inter-chain RBD-NTD connection is thus found to impact the RBD hinge interaction by upregulating more RBD-up conformation (Fig. 4D ). In the absence of such interchain interaction, the RBD mostly stays in the down conformation allowing RBD to break the symmetry rarely in a stochastic manner (Fig. 4E ). The absence of inter-chain RBD-NTD connection also appears to impact the SARS-CoV RBD hinge interaction. Here, the opening of RBD-S1 cleft is significantly less than that of SARS-CoV-2 S in their respective S1-head-up state (Fig. S6 ). The assistance from the inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk related interfacial contacts are also found to modulate the population dynamics of RBD-down conformation (Fig. S7 ). The influence of this inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk interaction has also been observed in an early Cryo-EM analyses where two proline mutations at the top of S2 stalk (inferring RBD-S2 inter-chain connection) helped to stabilize the 'up' conformers of SARS-CoV S (30) .</td>\n",

The pilot ran for five months, and was followed by a three month consultation process that concluded in April 2019. Rather than a single service, AuroraAI is an attempt to revolutionize current public management practices -from focused on efficiency and production outputs to placing customers need at the centre of the interaction. 14 : See https://tietokayttoon.fi/julkaisu?pubid=29903 This 'human-centricity' -as the documents call it -envisages an iterative development of public services with significant inputs from citizens and businesses, and through the lens of 'life-events', that is focal points / situations that require increased interaction between the citizen and the state. AuroraAI is thought of as a platform or a service network, where the public operator sets specific technological-and process-requirements, as well as ethical boundaries, allowing anyone to develop their value proposition within the platform. The rationale of the project stems from the growing sustainability gap of the public finances, and the deterioration of the dependency rate, and a hope that new, personalized service chains will cater better to the changing realities of the XXI century.</td>\n",

The key lesson is for healthcare workers to be vigilant and prepared to institute infection control measures should the need arise. Thus, education of health and support workers in infection control is vital. They should know current guidelines and be able to incorporate them into their usual work pattern. However, the continued high incidence of hospital-related infections indicates that, despite strong research evidence for changing practice, this may not occur for years due to lack of knowledge, expertise or equipment. 1 The SARS Expert Committee in Hong Kong found that hospital infection control standards were inadequate and in need of audit, development and implementation and that hospital staff needed training in infection control measures. 2 A survey of 306 nurses in an acute hospital in Hong Kong noted low compliance with, and selective adoption of, universal precautions. 3 However, no study has examined healthcare and support workers' compliance with isolation precautions.</td>\n",

They are caused by a broad spectrum of established respiratory tract pathogens, particularly by viruses including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most important cause of severe respiratory tract infections in young children, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses (229E, OC43), and adenoviruses. Studies investigating the entire spectrum of established respiratory tract pathogens are rare and mostly based on the detection of pathogen specific antibodies. Only in recent years, a few studies became available presenting data based on the direct detection of relevant infectious agents. Creer and co-workers [1] identified at least one potential pathogen in 69% of specimens from adults suffering from lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI, 63% contained viruses, 26% contained bacteria) still leaving a significant diagnostic gap to be filled with so far unidentified pathogenic microorganisms. Additional agents associated with respiratory tract infections have been discovered recently, e.g. the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [2], coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1) [3,4], and the human bocavirus (HBoV) [5]. Furthermore, herpes viruses may contribute to fill this gap as they are assumed to trigger respiratory tract infections [6,7]. Unfortunately, relevant studies did not often include them.</td>\n",

Firstly, interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 might result in diarrhoea. A recent bioinformatics analysis revealed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in alveolar type II (AT2) cells in the lung, but also in the glandular cells of gastric and duodenal epithelia [44] . Similar findings were found in the study by Liang et al. [45] , ACE2 was highly expressed in proximal and distal enterocytes, directly exposed to food and foreign pathogens. The ACE2-expressing enterocytes are invaded by SARS-CoV-2, leading to malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion and activated enteric nervous system, resulting in diarrhoea finally [44] . Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 indirectly damages the digestive system through a chain of inflammatory responses [42] . Another possible factor causing diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients might be antibiotic associated diarrhea [43] . Finally, changes in the composition and function of digestive tract flora mutually affect the respiratory tract through immune regulation, the so-called ''gut-lung axis\" [46] .</td>\n",

Thus, early detection of cardiac biomarkers with high sensitivity is imperative in clinical diagnostics. Various analytical techniques have been used, such as turbidimetry, SPR and immunoassays.

In Chicago, around 70% of deaths have involved people of Black origin despite them making up only 30% of the population, and similar figures have been observed in several other states. 1 2 Estimates suggest that American counties where Black residents are in the majority have almost six times the rate of death due to COVID19 compared to counties with predominantly White residents. 2 In the UK, COVID19 deaths have only recently been reported by ethnic group, showing that 19% of deaths occurring in hospital have involved individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, even though these groups make up only 14% of the population. 3 Similarly Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups accounted for 35% of all COVID19 patients in critical care units in England. 4 BAME groups may be at greater risk of infection, severe disease and poor outcomes for multiple reasons. These include socioeconomic conditions that increase risk of transmission and vulnerability 5 The extent to which the higher COVID19 mortality in BAME groups is primarily due to socioeconomic inequalities is not fully understood and there has been little or no research investigating whether poverty itself is an independent risk factor for COVID19 mortality. The same risks outlined above, e.g. household overcrowding, reliance on public transport, working in essential occupations and increased comorbidities, are also associated with living in poverty, as well as ethnicity. It is challenging to disentangle the potential impacts of socioeconomic factors and ethnicity on adverse health outcomes and there has been much debate, in the UK, about whether ethnic inequalities in health in general are primarily explained by socioeconomic inequalities. 12 13 Ethnic minority groups in the UK are more likely to live in socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods compared to the White British population, and are more likely to experience poverty and unemployment. 14 15 It is important to understand the relationship between ethnicity, poverty, and mortality due to COVID19 in order that resources and control measures can be better targeted at the communities most at risk -now and in the aftermath of the pandemic. We do not know, however, the extent to which these factors explain differences in risk between communities in England. To address this gap, we investigated the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates across areas of England, whilst controlling for population density, the age composition of the population and the duration of the epidemic in each area.</td>\n",

Payan's 12 was a rare study where a cell culture system (HepG2) was used to assay the infectivity of human hepatitis B virus before and after its exposure to several types of disinfectants. Sattar 14 presented an overview on viruses and their mounting significance as nosocomial pathogens, with the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and noroviruses as examples; it was also noted that there are major gaps in our knowledge on the exact mechanisms of spread of many types of viruses in hospital settings and prevention and control strategies to be applied. Rosselló-Urgell 11 described how recently introduced surveillance programs are generating useful information on the incidence of nosocomial infections in Spain. The design and application of these programs has been possible due to unprecedented collaboration between government agencies, scientific societies and the pharmaceutical industry. The Spanish expertise and experience are now ready to be applied in other European countries.</td>\n",

In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and \"heat-not-burn\" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid-19. Little attention has been given to the role of smoking in either the transmission of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, actual virus) or mortality rate of Covid-19 (name of the disease caused). Smokers contract more respiratory ailments, including colds (commonly rhinoviruses, but also coronaviruses) than non-smokers. Smokers also show double the influenza rate and increased rates of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The damage caused to the lungs by smoking makes patients more susceptible to pulmonary infections, both bacterial and viral [6] . Smokers are 34% more likely than non-smokers to contract the flu [6] . Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection [7] . Smoking is the primary etiological factor behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the developed world, but environmental pollution and degrading air quality are also responsible in developing countries. It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world [8] . Vaccination against influenza is strongly recommended for patients with COPD, as the frequency and progression of exacerbations are strongly linked to respiratory viruses </td>\n",

Virus entry and activity are primarily related to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [ACE2] receptor, which provides a human cell-binding site for the S protein of SARS-coronavirus [SARS-CoV], NL63-coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2. 1 ACE2 is physiologically expressed by lung alveolar epithelial cells and plays an important regulatory role. The engagement between the virus and ACE2 appears to be associated with a dysregulation of ACE2, and could lead to acute lung injury. Smoking upregulates the ACE2 receptor, 1 probably explaining why these individuals are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. 2 Similarly, an elegant study demonstrated that the expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPP4], was upregulated in the lungs of smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, providing further data in favour of this theory. 2 Importantly, there are well-known opposing effects of smoking in ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]. Indeed smoking has been demonstrated to be protective in UC, whereas in CD it has been shown to be associated with a more severe course. In line with previous reports, the percentage of active smokers was higher in CD than in UC patients [3.5% versus 2%, respectively] in the Wuhan inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] registry. 3 This difference partly explains why the overall mortality is slightly increased in CD patients with lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [pooled standardised mortality ratio: (1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.30-1.50). 4 In a recent article by An and colleagues 3 on the measures adopted by the Wuhan IBD centre to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], none of the 318 registered IBD patients reported </td>\n",

However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. Objective: We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. Methods: Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood 2000 high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. Results: In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. Conclusion: The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.

Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. . We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype. The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients. High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/μl ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/μl, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with : medRxiv preprint eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566,], p=0.039). Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients. Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation. </td>\n",

Objective: To summarize current understanding of the effects of novel and prior coronaviruses on human reproduction, specifically male and female gametes, and in pregnancy. Design: Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6, 2020. Methods: Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results: Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropindependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported.

The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29-34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 Interpretation The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature. </td>\n",

Methods Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary interest and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. Results Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and the severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p = 0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p = 0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p = 0.71). There were 22 pregnant women delivered 23 live births either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%) and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions Pregnant women have comparable clinical course and outcomes compared with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2. No evidence supported vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the late stage of pregnancy including vaginal delivery. </td>\n",

Data sources: We searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto 28 3 rd May 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" or 29 \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" or \"SARS-COV-2\" and \"pregnancy\". We also included 30 data from preprint articles. 31 Study eligibility criteria : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with 32 diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 33 Study appraisal and synthesis methods : We included 50 studies reporting the information on 34 441 pregnant women and 391 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health 35 characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also 37 recorded. 38 Results: Out of 441 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 387 women have delivered. 39 There are nine maternal deaths reported. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common 40 symptoms were fever (56%), cough (43%), myalgia (19%), dyspnea (18%) and diarrhea (6%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 96 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (80%), preterm labor (26%), 43 fetal distress (8%) and premature rupture of membranes (9%). Six still births (2%) are reported. The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were 45 hypertensive disorders (10%), diabetes (9%), placental disorders (2%), co-infections (3%), : medRxiv preprint 3 scarred uterus (3%) and hypothyroidism (3%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, 47 preterm birth (25%), respiratory distress syndrome (8%), pneumonia (8%) were reported. There 48 were four neonatal deaths reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to 49 be 8%. 50 Conclusion 51 In pregnant women with COVID-19, hypertensive disorders and diabetes are common co-52 morbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery and maternal death. Amongst the neonates 53 born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common 54 occurrence. There are reports of still births and neonatal deaths. There is an evidence of vertical 55 transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women with COVID-19. 56 57 : medRxiv preprint 61 Coronaviruses are known to infect humans, other mammals, and birds causing respiratory, 62 enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases 1 . Amongst these is a novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, 63 first time reported from Wuhan in China in December 2019 and causes a potentially life-64 threating respiratory disease termed as COVID-19 2 . Since then, SARS-CoV-2 infection is 65 reported from every country in the world has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive 66 public health problem. Owing to the high rates of human to human transmission, WHO declared 67 COVID-19 as a pandemic 3 . More than 3.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and almost 68 2,24,172 reported deaths (upto 1st May, 2020), the pandemic has reportedly affected more than 69 180 countries/regions globally and majority of them are in local transmission phase 4 . Since this 70 virus has not been detected in humans before, limited information is available about its effect on 71 people; almost negligible information is available in pregnant women. Previously, members of 72 the coronavirus family such as (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-73 CoV) are reported to be associated with severe complications during pregnancy like miscarriage, 74 fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and maternal deaths 5 . During the influenza pandemic in 75 1918, there was a higher mortality (37%) among pregnant women as compared to mortality rate 76 in the overall population (2.6%) 6 . During the SARS Co-V pandemic in 2003, 50% of pregnant 77 women with SARS Co-V infection were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Out of these, 78 around 33% of pregnant required mechanical ventilation, with mortality rate of 25% 7 . 79 80 Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, 81 due to various factors such as physiologic changes in the immune and cardiopulmonary systems 82 (e.g. elevation of the diaphragm, increased oxygen consumption, and edema of respiratory tract 83 .

Furthermore, during the pandemic, hospital 84 visits may enhance the chances of infection and conversely lack of medical care during 85 pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, there is an urgent need to devise appropriate management 86 protocols for pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is 87 desired during the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, this would require a thorough 88 situational analysis of COVID-19 and pregnancy. 89 90 OBJECTIVE 91 The aim of this systematic review was to assess the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant 92 women with COVID-19. We also assessed if there is any evidence of the maternal-fetal 93 transmission of SARS CO-V-2 infection. We believe this information will aid obstetricians and 94 neonatologists to take evidence based decisions to manage pregnant women with COVID-19 and 95 their newborns. This information will also help the societies of obstetricians and gynecologists to 96 devise appropriate guidelines and management of pregnancy and coronavirus diseases in general. 97 98 METHODS Eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy 100 We performed a systematic search in PUBMED, Medline, Google Scholar, preprint servers 101 medRxiv, bioRxiv and arXiv databases utilizing combinations of word variants for 102 \"coronavirus\", 2019 n-COV. or \"COVID-19\" and \"pregnancy\".

The clinical features and laboratory results of different age groups are different due to the general susceptibility of the disease. The laboratory findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women are also conflicting. Para-clinical investigations including laboratory tests and radiologic findings play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The majority of previous reports on the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory results were based on data from the general population and limited information is available based on age difference and pregnancy status. This review aimed to describe the COVID-19 laboratory findings in neonates, children, adults, elderly and pregnant women altogether for the first time. The most attracting and reliable markers of COVID-19 in patients were: normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and very different and conflicting laboratory results regardless of clinical symptoms in neonates, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation in children, lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in adult patients, lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH in the elderly people and high CRP, leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio in pregnant women. </td>\n",

Prospective cohort study. Participants: 669 positive Covid-19 patients within a cohort of 502,536 UK Biobank participants, recruited between 2006 and 2010. The main outcome measure was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. We also assessed risk factors for inpatient and outpatient status for Covid-19 positive individuals. We found that black participants were at over three times increased risk of testing positive for Covid-19, relative to white participants, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28 to 4.31). Asian participants were also at higher risk of Covid-19 (ARR 2.03, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.95). Next, we analyzed the association of comorbidities with Covid-19.

Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61].

The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe conditions. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, as well as important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis. </td>\n",

The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe conditions. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, as well as important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis. </td>\n",

Prospective cohort study. Participants: 669 positive Covid-19 patients within a cohort of 502,536 UK Biobank participants, recruited between 2006 and 2010. The main outcome measure was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. We also assessed risk factors for inpatient and outpatient status for Covid-19 positive individuals. We found that black participants were at over three times increased risk of testing positive for Covid-19, relative to white participants, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28 to 4.31).

Objective: To summarize current understanding of the effects of novel and prior coronaviruses on human reproduction, specifically male and female gametes, and in pregnancy. Design: Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6, 2020. Methods: Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results: Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropindependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection may adversely affect some pregnant women and their offspring. Additional studies are needed to assess effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male and female fertility. </td>\n",

We declare no conflict of interest. Abstract: Since SARS-CoV-2 infection was first identified in December 2019, it spread rapidly and a global pandemic of COVID-19 has occurred. ACE2, the receptor for entry into the target cells by SARS-CoV-2, was found to abundantly express in testes, including spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. However, there is no clinical evidence about whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect male gonadal function so far. In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients. This study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of COVID-19 on male sex hormones, alerting more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men. </td>\n",

The features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, and laboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results: We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to conversion was 9.71 (95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/µL) of CD8 + T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively.

The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible. We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

Public knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 are essential in suppressing its pandemic status. : A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between 19th of March and 6th of April 2020 in three Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) to explore the knowledge and practices of Middle Eastern population towards COVID-19. A previously developed questionnaire was used. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1,208 participants were involved in this study from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females and aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%). Participants had moderate overall COVID-19 knowledge with a mean score of 7.93 (±1.72) out of 12, 66.1%. Participants had better knowledge about disease prevention and control with 83.0%, whereas the lowest sub-scale scores were for questions about disease transmission routes (43.3%). High education level was an important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p<0.01). Conclusion: Middle Eastern participants are of a relatively low level of knowledge about COVID-19, particularly regarding its transmission routes. Policymakers are recommended to develop informative COVID-19 related campaigns targeted specifically towards university students, unemployed individuals and those with lower levels of education. </td>\n",

In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host−virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, with regard to the effects of inflammatory markers on the severity of COVID-19, studies have reported associations that vary in strength and direction. In the meta-analysis, we aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with severity of COVID-19. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang database and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) database until March 20, 2020. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. : A total of 16 studies were included in our analysis comprising of 3962 patients with COVID-19. Random-effects results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in non-severe group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = -8.40 mm/h, 95% CI = [-14.32, -2.48], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 μg/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group. Moreover, survivors had lower level for IL-6 than non-survivors with COVID-19 (WMD = -4.80 ng/ml, 95% CI = [ -5.87, -3.73], P < 0.001). These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment. The meta-analysis highlights the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19. Measurement of inflammatory markers might help clinicians to monitor and evaluate the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. </td>\n",

A consideration of possible impacts of COVID-19 on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly, is briefly outlined by drawing on a variety of literatures. A consideration of the characteristics of COVID-19, along with what research suggests have been the impacts of other past events that in some ways roughly parallel COVID-19, points toward avenues of future investigation. </td>\n",
