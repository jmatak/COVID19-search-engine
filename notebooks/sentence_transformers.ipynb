Coronaviruses cause a variety of diseases in mammals and birds ranging from enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease in chickens to potentially lethal human respiratory infections. Here we provide a brief introduction to coronaviruses discussing their replication and pathogenicity, and current prevention and treatment strategies. We also discuss the outbreaks of the highly pathogenic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identifi ed Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm as depicted in recent studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy [ 2 , 3 ]. The most prominent feature of coronaviruses is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion. These spikes are a defi ning feature of the virion and give them the appearance of a solar corona, prompting the name, coronaviruses. Within the envelope of the virion is the nucleocapsid. Coronaviruses have helically symmetrical nucleocapsids, which is uncommon among positive-sense RNA viruses, but far more common for negative-sense RNA viruses. </td>\n",

In this study, a one-step real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on SYBR Green chemistry and degenerate primers was developed for the generic detection of coronaviruses. The primers, designed in the open reading frame 1b, enabled the detection of 32 animal coronaviruses including strains of canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). A specific amplification was also observed with the human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The real-time RT-PCR detected down to 10 cRNA copies from TGEV, BCoV, SARS-CoV and IBV. In addition, the assay exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity on clinical samples from different animal species. The developed assay represents a potential tool for laboratory diagnostics and for detecting still uncharacterized coronaviruses. </td>\n",

The etiologic agent was initially identified as a coronavirus by thin-section electron microscopic examination of a virus isolate. Virions were spherical, 78 nm in mean diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. We show that infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus resulted in distinct ultrastructural features: double-membrane vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm. These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells. Electron microscopic studies were critical in identifying the etiologic agent of the SARS outbreak and in guiding subsequent laboratory and epidemiologic investigations. </td>\n",

What is known of the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is limited, but clinical observations suggest that both viral-induced cytotoxicity and host immune-mediated destruction contribute to the severity of disease. This summary discusses recent advances in coronavirus research that will facilitate the identification of crucial molecular targets for the rational design of SARS therapeutics. When the SARS coronavirus came dramatically to attention as a fatal and potentially pandemic respiratory disease, the scientific response was swift and effective. The etiological agent was identified, the genome was cloned and sequenced, and large strides have been made in understanding key points in the viral life cycle, including recent identification of a functional host cell receptor and solution of the three-dimensional structure of the viral attachment protein. Much of this progress was possible only because a foundation of basic coronavirus biology existed. The Denison laboratory has been at the forefront of the small group of investigators who have dissected the basic features of coronaviruses. Denison has discovered critical mechanisms in the life cycle of the coronaviruses and is a key figure in the effective and urgent application of this knowledge to SARS. </td>\n",

Communityacquired human coronaviruses have long been recognized to cause common cold. However, zoonotic coronaviruses are now becoming more a global concern with the discovery of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses causing severe respiratory diseases. Infections by these emerging human coronaviruses are characterized by less robust interferon production. Treatment of patients with recombinant interferon regimen promises beneficial outcomes, suggesting that compromised interferon expression might contribute at least partially to the severity of disease. The mechanisms by which coronaviruses evade host innate antiviral response are under intense investigations. This review focuses on the fierce arms race between host innate antiviral immunity and emerging human coronaviruses. Particularly, the host pathogen recognition receptors and the signal transduction pathways to mount an effective antiviral response against SARS and MERS coronavirus infection are discussed. On the other hand, the counter-measures evolved by SARS and MERS coronaviruses to circumvent host defense are also dissected. With a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between host and coronaviruses, it is hoped that insights on the pathogenesis of newly-identified highly pathogenic human coronaviruses and new strategies in antiviral development can be derived. </td>\n",

None of these strategies has progressed to an approved human coronavirus vaccine in the ten years since SARS-CoV emerged.

However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector PROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The semm samples of the adult group had coronavims-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8/51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20/51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavims infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections. 0166-0934/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
