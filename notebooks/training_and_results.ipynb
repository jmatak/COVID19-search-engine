Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

Cigarette smoking decreases lung function, and evidently poses a general risk factor for severe respiratory infections, thus there is an apparent association between cigarette smoking and COVID-19 severity. The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more severe in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further investigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of second-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according to published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be well assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function as early as 1 month. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as part of public health measures to limit the global impact of COVID-19.</td>\n",

However, there are limitations that cannot be addressed with currently available evidence and data. Confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, should be considered in examining if access of Chinese smokers with COVID-19 to hospital care may be different as compared to the non-smoking population. While the pooled prevalence of smoking was not adjusted for gender, gender distribution of the patients included in the studies was similar to population estimates (51.1% males). [27] At this time, it is impossible to perform a multivariate analysis or examine the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization according to the smoking status in a population-representative sample. The consistency and accuracy of the recorded smoking status are also unknown. Considering the emergency of the epidemic, it is possible that the smoking status of patients was not accurately recorded or some patients were unable to report their smoking status. It is also possible that some patients may have been in critical condition at the time they were hospitalized, which would compromise their communication capacity and their ability to report their smoking status. One study reported that the group of never smokers included patients with unknown smoking status, but the authors did not report the number of patients with unknown smoking status. [14] One study mentioned that “few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years”, but it was unclear if only patients with 30 pack years or more were presented in the study table [19]. At the same time, two studies may have included former smokers into the groups referred to as “smoking” or “smoking history” [23, 25]. In any case, the large difference between smoking prevalence among patients and population smoking prevalence is difficult to be fully explained by missing data on the smoking status. The smoking status was not objectively assessed, but this is common and expected practice in case series of hospitalized patients. Another possibility is that some patients may have quit smoking shortly after disease initiation and before admission to hospital; these patients would be registered as former smokers. However, the secondary analysis, which classified former smokers as current smokers, also found a low pooled smoking prevalence. While only 3 out of the 13 studies reported former smoking and 2 studies reported smoking without clarifying if they were current or former smokers, a study by Lui et al. found that only 8.4% of males and 0.8% of females in China were former smokers [28]. Consider the low prevalence of former smoking in the Chinese population, it is possible that none of the patients were former smokers in some of the studies. Another limitation is that differences in population smoking prevalence may exist between age groups, considering that age is a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization would be more likely for older people. A study by Liu et al. reported that the highest smoking prevalence in China was observed in males aged 40–59 years [28]. The median age in all the studies analyzed herein was < 59 years. Additionally, high smoking prevalence was observed among older Chinese males by Liu et al. Specifically, the prevalence of current smoking in males was: 46.5% in 18–29 years, 57.6% in 30–39 years, 60.3% in 40–49 years, 59.5% in 50–59 years, 52.2% in 60–69 years and 41.5% in 70+ years. In females, the highest smoking rates were observed in those aged 50 years or higher (4.7–8.7%) compared to younger age groups (1.7–2.6%) [28]. Moreover, the 2018 GATS reported that prevalence of current smoking was 57.7% and 2.7% in males and females, respectively, in age groups 45–64 years, and 44% and 4.1%, respectively, in age group ≥ 65 years [12]. Thus, it is unlikely that age was a factor that substantially affected the present analysis. In any case, the calculated pooled prevalence of current smoking was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence in China. Such a difference could only be explained by massive under-reporting of current smoking.</td>\n",

(18, 29) . The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .</td>\n",

In 2018, the population smoking prevalence was 26.6% with a much higher prevalence in men (50.5%) than in women (2.1%) (World Health Organization, 2018). Therefore, a high smoking prevalence among patients with COVID-19 would be expected, even if smoking did not adversely affect disease susceptibility and severity. It is obviously inappropriate to suggest that anyone should initiate smoking or to continue to smoke due to the well-established smoking-related morbidities and the large number of potentially toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke. Furthermore, it is unlikely that any other compound in tobacco cigarette smoke, besides nicotine, would be implicated to the potential benefits observed in smokers. Moreover, due to the adverse effects of smoking and the fact that many smokers would suffer from co-morbidities (such as cardiovascular disease, COPD etc.), it is expected that the potential benefits of nicotine would be blunted when observed in smokers.</td>\n",

Smoking may increase ACE2, the receptor for SARS-Co-V-2 2 thereby increasing disease risk; however cigarette smoking has also been shown to downregulate ACE2 3 , thereby possibly reducing such risk. An analysis of 5 studies reporting patient smoking status determined that, relative to the population of smokers in China, current smokers were underrepresented in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 by, in some cases, a factor of 10 4 . A pre-print review article, while concluding that smoking increased severity of COVID-19 progression, reported underrepresentation of smokers in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients, relative to the smoking populations in China, Korea, and USA 4 . Although there are many possible explanations for these findings, together these results nevertheless suggest a protective effect of smoking on susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2.</td>\n",

First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

We also understand and appreciate the challenges she describes in systematically identifying and reporting pregnancies during a public health emergency response such as occurred with SARS. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we have recognized that it is critical that pregnancy information be collected systematically as part of the medical intake process. This can be accomplished by asking a simple, short question about pregnancy status (i.e.,\"Are you or do you think you could be pregnant?\") as women are being evaluated and processed as part of an emergency response plan. Urine pregnancy testing may be used to verify pregnancy status for women who are unsure (2) . Besides helping tailor the provision of healthcare in these settings, pregnancy status information should also be used to track pregnancy outcomes.</td>\n",

The complex interplay between biological and behav ioural risk factors needs to be recognised during the COVID19 pandemic. It is not yet known whether the higher COVID19 case fatality rates reported in men compared with women in China, South Korea, and Italy 3 to date are attributed to sexspecific biological susceptibility, variations in preexisting comorbidities, behavioural risk factors, or some combination of these factors. 4, 5 In terms of behavioural risk factors, women's risk of contracting COVID19 may be higher than men's risk as women are frontline providers, comprising 70% of the global health and social care workforce, and they do three times as much unpaid care work at home as men. 2, 6 Moreover, pregnant women could be at risk of pregnancyrelated complications during the COVID19 pandemic. 7 Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome were associated with increased risk of pregnancyrelated morbidity and mortality, 7 but data on COVID19 are scarce. 8 In China, among nine women in their third trimester with COVID19, clinical outcomes were similar to non pregnant adults. 4 Yet another study of 33 neonates born to mothers with COVID19 identified intrauterine vertical transmission of COVID19 in three neonates. 9 However, studies to date have been based on third trimester cases and viral infections during pregnancy are typically most severe during the first 20 weeks of gestation. 10 Disruption of services and diversion of resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health care because of prioritising the COVID19 response are expected to increase risks of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. 6, 7 Globally, there are anticipated shortages of contraception. 11 Sexual and reproductive health providers and clinics, which are the primary care providers and safety net for women of reproductive aged, youth, those uninsured for health care, and people on low incomes in many countries including in the USA, may also be deemed nonessential and diverted to respond to COVID19. 6 Past humanitarian crises have shown that reduced access to family planning, abortion, antenatal, HIV, genderbased violence, and mental health care services results in increased rates and sequelae from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy complications, miscarriage, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, intimate partner violence, and maternal and infant mortality. 1, 12 Additionally, systemic racism, dis crimi nation, and stigma are likely to further compound logistical barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health care for women and marginalised groups.</td>\n",

However, the effect of SARS-COV2 on early pregnancy is still unknown. An individual participant data meta-analysis showed pregnancy was a risk factor for severe influenza infection (Mertz et al., 2019) , and influenza vaccination reduces the risk of mild to moderately severe LCI disease during pregnancy (Thompson et al., 2019) . Furthermore, limited information associated with SARS might provide insights into COVID-19's effects 7 during pregnancy. SARS during pregnancy could be associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), Wong et al reported seven women infected with SARS in the first trimester, four had a spontaneous abortion (Wong et al., 2004) . During early pregnancy, human placental RAS was upregulated and played an important role in placental vascular development (Pringle et al., 2011) . Another research showed a high level of ACE2 mRNA in the placenta in early pregnancy, which was located in syncytiotrophoblast (STBs) and villous stroma, and ACE2 also regulated the release of Ang1-7, which was beneficial for maternal-fetal circulation vasodilation, and favorable for virus spread(la Pena et al., 2018) . Zheng QL et al analyzed the mRNA expression profile, and found that ACE2 had a very low expression in the different cell types (STB cells, decidual stromal cells and epithelial glandular cells) of maternal-fetal interface, except slightly high expression in decidual perivascular cells cluster 1 (PV1)(Zheng QL, 2020). So, we presumed the potential effect of COVID-19 on early pregnancy as follows: (i) Due to the lack of \"susceptible cells\" at the interface between mother and infant in early pregnancy, the rate of mother to infant transmission might be very low; (ii) SARS-COV2 might change the expression of ACE2 at the interface between mother and infant in early pregnancy, leading to a pregnancy loss.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

We therefore assessed the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates in England. England. We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using negative binomial regression models, whilst adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80+ years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.04]. Interpretation: This study provides evidence that both income deprivation and ethnicity are associated with greater COVID19 mortality. To reduce these inequalities governments need to target effective control measures at these disadvantaged communities, ensuring investment of resources reflects their greater need and vulnerability to the pandemic. </td>\n",

Indeed, incidents of coinfection with multiple viruses were detected using multi-target analysis such as multiplex PCR or next-generation sequencing [2–7].

First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

For example, warming temperatures encourage outdoor activities, 17 possibly changing the intensity of social interaction. Finally, temperature has a direct effect on other causes of morbidity and mortality, with particularly large impacts on elderly populations.

Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10°C to 36°C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. Conclusions: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation. </td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID19 transmission. Modelbased predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID19.</td>\n",

For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others. 3 By contrast, for COVID19, the serial interval is estimated at 4·4-7·5 days, which is more similar to SARS. 4 First among the important unknowns about COVID19 is the case fatality rate (CFR), which requires information on the denominator that defines the number infected. We are unaware of any completed largescale serology surveys to detect specific antibodies to COVID19. Best estimates suggest a CFR for COVID19 of about 0·3-1%, 4 which is higher than the order of 0·1% CFR for a moderate influenza A season. 5 The second unknown is the whether infectiousness starts before onset of symptoms. The incubation period for COVID19 is about 5-6 days. 4, 6 Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infec tiousness (appendix 1). For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1-2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness. 7 There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period, 8 pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1-2 days before onset of symptoms. If these patterns are verified by more extensive clinical virological studies, COVID19 would be expected to be more like influenza A than SARS. For SARS, peak infectiousness took place many days after first symptoms, hence the success of quarantine of patients with SARS soon after symptoms started 7 and the lack of success for this measure for influenza A and possibly for COVID19.</td>\n",

Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts.

Unfortunately, we can neither measure the basic nor the effective reproduction number directly. However, throughout the past four months, the COVID-19 pandemic has probably generated more quantitative data than any infectious disease in history. Machine learning offers incredible opportunities to evaluate these data and learn correlations and trends [32, 47] . Here we learn the effective reproduction number R(t) directly from the reported COVID-19 cases in all 27 countries of the European Union, starting from the day of the first reported case on January 24, until today, April 25, 2020. This not only allows us to identify the model parameters and confidence intervals, but also to quantify correlations between travel restrictions and reduced effective reproduction numbers. Table 3 and Figures 2 to 4 summarize our basic reproduction numbers R 0 and the reduced effective reproduction numbers R t for all 27 countries. Our mean basic reproduction number of R 0 = 4.50 ± 1.44 exceeds the first estimates of 1.4 to 2.5 from the World Health Organization based on a tracing study that reported a value of 2.2 during the early outbreak in Wuhan [27] . However, our results agree well with the more recent values of 5.7 for the Wuhan outbreak [39] and with a recent review that suggested values from 4.1 to 6.5 calculated with SEIR models [29] . Our basic reproduction number of 4.5 is lower than the numbers of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [2] . Compared to the SARS coronavirus with a range from 2 to 5 [29] , our values of SARS-CoV-2 in Table 3 are rather on the high end, suggesting that the new coronavirus would spread more rapidly than SARS. Knowing the precise basic reproduction number will be critical to estimate the number of contacts to trace, if we want to successfully control the dynamics of COVID-19 through contact trancing [18] .</td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

Unfortunately, we can neither measure the basic nor the effective reproduction number directly. However, throughout the past four months, the COVID-19 pandemic has probably generated more quantitative data than any infectious disease in history. Machine learning offers incredible opportunities to evaluate these data and learn correlations and trends [32, 47] . Here we learn the effective reproduction number R(t) directly from the reported COVID-19 cases in all 27 countries of the European Union, starting from the day of the first reported case on January 24, until today, April 25, 2020. This not only allows us to identify the model parameters and confidence intervals, but also to quantify correlations between travel restrictions and reduced effective reproduction numbers. Table 3 and Figures 2 to 4 summarize our basic reproduction numbers R 0 and the reduced effective reproduction numbers R t for all 27 countries. Our mean basic reproduction number of R 0 = 4.50 ± 1.44 exceeds the first estimates of 1.4 to 2.5 from the World Health Organization based on a tracing study that reported a value of 2.2 during the early outbreak in Wuhan [27] . However, our results agree well with the more recent values of 5.7 for the Wuhan outbreak [39] and with a recent review that suggested values from 4.1 to 6.5 calculated with SEIR models [29] . Our basic reproduction number of 4.5 is lower than the numbers of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [2] . Compared to the SARS coronavirus with a range from 2 to 5 [29] , our values of SARS-CoV-2 in Table 3 are rather on the high end, suggesting that the new coronavirus would spread more rapidly than SARS. Knowing the precise basic reproduction number will be critical to estimate the number of contacts to trace, if we want to successfully control the dynamics of COVID-19 through contact trancing [18] .</td>\n",

The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 [7] . Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11] . However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12] . The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13] , which is slightly higher than that of SARS.</td>\n",

The variation in frequencies from 18% to 56% may reflect differing viral incidences as well as differences in the range of viruses screened for in routine respiratory samples referred for diagnosis</td>\n",

We also understand and appreciate the challenges she describes in systematically identifying and reporting pregnancies during a public health emergency response such as occurred with SARS. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we have recognized that it is critical that pregnancy information be collected systematically as part of the medical intake process. This can be accomplished by asking a simple, short question about pregnancy status (i.e.,\"Are you or do you think you could be pregnant?\") as women are being evaluated and processed as part of an emergency response plan. Urine pregnancy testing may be used to verify pregnancy status for women who are unsure (2) .

However, the effect of SARS-COV2 on early pregnancy is still unknown. An individual participant data meta-analysis showed pregnancy was a risk factor for severe influenza infection (Mertz et al., 2019) , and influenza vaccination reduces the risk of mild to moderately severe LCI disease during pregnancy (Thompson et al., 2019) . Furthermore, limited information associated with SARS might provide insights into COVID-19's effects 7 during pregnancy. SARS during pregnancy could be associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications, such as spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), Wong et al reported seven women infected with SARS in the first trimester, four had a spontaneous abortion (Wong et al., 2004) . During early pregnancy, human placental RAS was upregulated and played an important role in placental vascular development (Pringle et al., 2011) . Another research showed a high level of ACE2 mRNA in the placenta in early pregnancy, which was located in syncytiotrophoblast (STBs) and villous stroma, and ACE2 also regulated the release of Ang1-7, which was beneficial for maternal-fetal circulation vasodilation, and favorable for virus spread(la Pena et al., 2018) . Zheng QL et al analyzed the mRNA expression profile, and found that ACE2 had a very low expression in the different cell types (STB cells, decidual stromal cells and epithelial glandular cells) of maternal-fetal interface, except slightly high expression in decidual perivascular cells cluster 1 (PV1)(Zheng QL, 2020). So, we presumed the potential effect of COVID-19 on early pregnancy as follows: (i) Due to the lack of \"susceptible cells\" at the interface between mother and infant in early pregnancy, the rate of mother to infant transmission might be very low; (ii) SARS-COV2 might change the expression of ACE2 at the interface between mother and infant in early pregnancy, leading to a pregnancy loss.</td>\n",

The complex interplay between biological and behav ioural risk factors needs to be recognised during the COVID19 pandemic. It is not yet known whether the higher COVID19 case fatality rates reported in men compared with women in China, South Korea, and Italy 3 to date are attributed to sexspecific biological susceptibility, variations in preexisting comorbidities, behavioural risk factors, or some combination of these factors. 4, 5 In terms of behavioural risk factors, women's risk of contracting COVID19 may be higher than men's risk as women are frontline providers, comprising 70% of the global health and social care workforce, and they do three times as much unpaid care work at home as men. 2, 6 Moreover, pregnant women could be at risk of pregnancyrelated complications during the COVID19 pandemic. 7 Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome were associated with increased risk of pregnancyrelated morbidity and mortality, 7 but data on COVID19 are scarce. 8 In China, among nine women in their third trimester with COVID19, clinical outcomes were similar to non pregnant adults. 4 Yet another study of 33 neonates born to mothers with COVID19 identified intrauterine vertical transmission of COVID19 in three neonates. 9 However, studies to date have been based on third trimester cases and viral infections during pregnancy are typically most severe during the first 20 weeks of gestation. 10 Disruption of services and diversion of resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health care because of prioritising the COVID19 response are expected to increase risks of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. 6, 7 Globally, there are anticipated shortages of contraception. 11 Sexual and reproductive health providers and clinics, which are the primary care providers and safety net for women of reproductive aged, youth, those uninsured for health care, and people on low incomes in many countries including in the USA, may also be deemed nonessential and diverted to respond to COVID19. 6 Past humanitarian crises have shown that reduced access to family planning, abortion, antenatal, HIV, genderbased violence, and mental health care services results in increased rates and sequelae from unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy complications, miscarriage, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, intimate partner violence, and maternal and infant mortality. 1, 12 Additionally, systemic racism, dis crimi nation, and stigma are likely to further compound logistical barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health care for women and marginalised groups.</td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

The incubation period of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the incubation period for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [5] [6] .

This newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2] . The key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3] [4] [5] and the transmission potential [6, 7] . In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.</td>\n",

We therefore assessed the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates in England. England. We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using negative binomial regression models, whilst adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80+ years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.04]. Interpretation: This study provides evidence that both income deprivation and ethnicity are associated with greater COVID19 mortality. To reduce these inequalities governments need to target effective control measures at these disadvantaged communities, ensuring investment of resources reflects their greater need and vulnerability to the pandemic. </td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

Per CDC guidelines that were last updated 3/9/2020, laboratory testing for COVID19 is only indicated for individuals who both develop respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID19 and meet additional criteria, such as being hospitalized, having certain comorbidities, and/or having contact with suspected COVID19+ individuals. 25 However, many COVID19+ individuals may be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. 26 In addition, COVID19 testing shortages may make the US statistics on COVID19 cases less reliable. 27 According to Dr.</td>\n",

Smoking may increase ACE2, the receptor for SARS-Co-V-2 2 thereby increasing disease risk; however cigarette smoking has also been shown to downregulate ACE2 3 , thereby possibly reducing such risk. An analysis of 5 studies reporting patient smoking status determined that, relative to the population of smokers in China, current smokers were underrepresented in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 by, in some cases, a factor of 10 4 . A pre-print review article, while concluding that smoking increased severity of COVID-19 progression, reported underrepresentation of smokers in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients, relative to the smoking populations in China, Korea, and USA 4 .

In 2018, the population smoking prevalence was 26.6% with a much higher prevalence in men (50.5%) than in women (2.1%) (World Health Organization, 2018). Therefore, a high smoking prevalence among patients with COVID-19 would be expected, even if smoking did not adversely affect disease susceptibility and severity. It is obviously inappropriate to suggest that anyone should initiate smoking or to continue to smoke due to the well-established smoking-related morbidities and the large number of potentially toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke. Furthermore, it is unlikely that any other compound in tobacco cigarette smoke, besides nicotine, would be implicated to the potential benefits observed in smokers. Moreover, due to the adverse effects of smoking and the fact that many smokers would suffer from co-morbidities (such as cardiovascular disease, COPD etc.), it is expected that the potential benefits of nicotine would be blunted when observed in smokers.</td>\n",

A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .</td>\n",

However, there are limitations that cannot be addressed with currently available evidence and data. Confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, should be considered in examining if access of Chinese smokers with COVID-19 to hospital care may be different as compared to the non-smoking population. While the pooled prevalence of smoking was not adjusted for gender, gender distribution of the patients included in the studies was similar to population estimates (51.1% males). [27] At this time, it is impossible to perform a multivariate analysis or examine the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization according to the smoking status in a population-representative sample. The consistency and accuracy of the recorded smoking status are also unknown. Considering the emergency of the epidemic, it is possible that the smoking status of patients was not accurately recorded or some patients were unable to report their smoking status. It is also possible Fig. 1 Random effects pooled prevalence of current smoking observed from 13 studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China. The forest plot depicts the fractional prevalence of smokers in each study. The size of the dark squares is proportional to the weight each study has in determining the combined effect size estimate. P < 0.001 for heterogeneity that some patients may have been in critical condition at the time they were hospitalized, which would compromise their communication capacity and their ability to report their smoking status. One study reported that the group of never smokers included patients with unknown smoking status, but the authors did not report the number of patients with unknown smoking status. [14] One study mentioned that \"few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years\", but it was unclear if only patients with 30 pack years or more were presented in the study table [19] . At the same time, two studies may have included former smokers into the groups referred to as \"smoking\" or \"smoking history\" [23, 25] . In any case, the large difference between smoking prevalence among patients and population smoking prevalence is difficult to be fully explained by missing data on the smoking status. The smoking status was not objectively assessed, but this is common and expected practice in case series of hospitalized patients. Another possibility is that some patients may have quit smoking shortly after disease initiation and before admission to hospital; these patients would be registered as former smokers. However, the secondary analysis, which classified former smokers as current smokers, also found a low pooled smoking prevalence. While only 3 out of the 13 studies reported former smoking and 2 studies reported smoking without clarifying if they were current or former smokers, a study by Lui et al. found that only 8.4% of males and 0.8% of females in China were former smokers [28] . Consider the low prevalence of former smoking in the Chinese population, it is possible that none of the patients were former smokers in some of the studies. Another limitation is that differences in population smoking prevalence may exist between age groups, considering that age is a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization would be more likely for older people. A study by Liu et al. reported that the highest smoking prevalence in China was observed in males aged 40-59 years [28] . The median age in all the studies analyzed herein was < 59 years. Additionally, high smoking prevalence was observed among older Chinese males by Liu et al. Specifically, the prevalence of current smoking in males was: 46.5% in 18-29 years, 57.6% in 30-39 years, 60.3% in 40-49 years, 59.5% in 50-59 years, 52.2% in 60-69 years and 41.5% in 70+ years. In females, the highest smoking rates were observed in those aged 50 years or higher (4.7-8.7%) compared to younger age groups (1.7-2.6%) [28] . Moreover, the 2018 GATS reported that prevalence of current smoking was 57.7% and 2.7% in males and females, respectively, in age groups 45-64 years, and 44% and 4.1%, respectively, in age group ≥ 65 years [12] . Thus, it is unlikely that age was a factor that substantially affected the present analysis. In any case, the calculated pooled prevalence of current smoking was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence in China. Such a difference could only be explained by massive underreporting of current smoking.</td>\n",

The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more severe in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further investigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of second-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according to published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be well assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The significance of this relationship remains even after the inclusion of additional variables such as maximum and minimum temperatures (averages) and time of exposure to the disease. Even with the complete specification that includes two binary variables capturing specific effects for the months of the year and controlling for population density, the results suggest that an increase in temperature is associated with a decrease in the number of infections.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",

First, temperature is likely to have a biological effect on the virus 2019-nCoV itself, as has been documented in lab experiments for influenza. 3 Second, temperature may change people's behavior, and thus change the number of new cases caused by a single infected individual. For example, warming temperatures encourage outdoor activities, 17 possibly changing the intensity of social interaction. Finally, temperature has a direct effect on other causes of morbidity and mortality, with particularly large impacts on elderly populations.

Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10°C to 36°C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. Conclusions: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation. </td>\n",

For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others. 3 By contrast, for COVID19, the serial interval is estimated at 4·4-7·5 days, which is more similar to SARS. 4 First among the important unknowns about COVID19 is the case fatality rate (CFR), which requires information on the denominator that defines the number infected. We are unaware of any completed largescale serology surveys to detect specific antibodies to COVID19. Best estimates suggest a CFR for COVID19 of about 0·3-1%, 4 which is higher than the order of 0·1% CFR for a moderate influenza A season. 5 The second unknown is the whether infectiousness starts before onset of symptoms. The incubation period for COVID19 is about 5-6 days. 4, 6 Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infec tiousness (appendix 1). For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1-2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness. 7 There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period, 8 pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1-2 days before onset of symptoms. If these patterns are verified by more extensive clinical virological studies, COVID19 would be expected to be more like influenza A than SARS. For SARS, peak infectiousness took place many days after first symptoms, hence the success of quarantine of patients with SARS soon after symptoms started 7 and the lack of success for this measure for influenza A and possibly for COVID19.</td>\n",

Although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia), under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China, this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection.</td>\n",

Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID19 transmission. Modelbased predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID19.</td>\n",

The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few superspreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1·1-1·5. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID19 epidemic.</td>\n",
